In addition to supporting cancer patients, the foundation also extends its assistance to women in rural areas, orphanages and other charitable causes, such as outreach programs aimed at combating hunger, including initiatives like 'Church on the Street.</p>
                            <p>The foundation's core message is centered around hope, self-affirmation, and body positivity, all aimed at inspiring women and girls to realize their full potential, irrespective of the challenges posed by illness or poverty.
